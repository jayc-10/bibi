General webpage to help me learn introductory HTML/CSS on my own (self-studying !!). I've always loved music and a good way I found to motivate myself was through work I am passionate about. I've made a webpage listing some of my favorites from her discography and I hope you enjoy them! The main image links to her artist profile and each sub-image link to their publication accordingly. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">

  <img src="publication/sample2.png" alt="socials" width="49%" />

"WHY IS THERE A FLAG OF PARAGUAY AT THE BOTTOM 😭😭😭"

Here's the story — I had a skill showcase for a club interview and I actually didn't know how to write it at the time. Afterwards, I learned the rest of HTML/CSS I was missing and I finally got it down! To challenge myself, I made the flag again but this time I made it perfect. YAY PARAGUAY !!! (I didnt't make the club 💀)
